so... you may have noticed 3 pages are incomplete, unfortunately this was out of my control, as my partners decided they didnt want to work on the project. The first and third page
were created by me(Joshua Santhosh), and the other 3 are by my classmates(Jaylen and Champ). I had a bit of assistance from a from a friend named Callmeglitch. Im sorry that you 
had to view the webpage as incomplete, but i did not have the time to complete their share of the project.
